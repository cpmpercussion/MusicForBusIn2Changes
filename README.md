![Belconnen Bus Interchange pre demolition]()

In 2009, the old Belconnen Bus Interchange was decommissioned and demolished, (much to the chagrin of concrete lovers everywhere… ). In the interchange’s final days, a mini-festival was in the weird space to celebrate the end of an era for everyday life in Belconnen.

This work is constructed in the SuperCollider music programming language from field recordings I took at the interchange at different times of day and night. The weekday bus timetable forms a score for the work with snippets of recordings triggered for each bus departing the interchange. In surround, the sounds come from the approximate position of the interchange’s platforms and move in the direction of the bus.

The pieces runs on a scale of two minutes to one second, meaning that the entire day’s buses, from the first service at 5:43am to the last after midnight is compressed into a 10 minute piece.

While I originally intended that the piece could be drawn out to a full day, this version gives a listenable snapshot of the phases of life in Belconnen with busy commuters in the morning to school kids at 4 o’clock and the weird radio channels they played late at night to keep teenagers from loitering.
